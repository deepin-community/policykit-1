Description: framework for managing administrative policies and privileges
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to
 granting access to privileged operations for unprivileged (desktop)
 applications.
 .
 In a typical use of polkit, an unprivileged application such as gnome-disks
 sends requests via D-Bus or other inter-process communication mechanisms
 to a privileged system service such as udisks, which asks polkitd for
 permission to process those requests. This allows the application to carry
 out privileged tasks without making use of setuid, which avoids several
 common sources of security vulnerabilities.
 .
 This package provides the polkitd D-Bus service and supporting programs.
 The pkexec program is not included, and can be found in the pkexec package.

Description: Legacy "local authority" (.pkla) backend for polkitd
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 This package configures the polkitd D-Bus service to read default
 authorization policies from .desktop-style files in subdirectories of
 /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority. It is compatible with the version of
 polkitd used in Debian 11 and older releases.

Description: run commands as another user with polkit authorization
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 pkexec is a setuid program to allow certain users to run commands as
 root or as a different user, similar to sudo. Unlike sudo, it carries
 out authentication and authorization by sending a request to polkit,
 so it uses desktop environments' familiar prompting mechanisms for
 authentication and uses polkit policies for authorization decisions.
 .
 By default, members of the 'sudo' Unix group can use pkexec to run any
 command after authenticating. The authorization rules can be changed by
 the local system administrator.
 .
 If this functionality is not required, removing the pkexec package will
 reduce security risk by removing a setuid program.

Description: transitional package for polkitd and pkexec
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 This transitional package depends on polkitd, the system service used by
 polkit, and pkexec, a setuid program analogous to sudo. They were
 historically packaged together, but have been separated so that users of
 polkitd are not required to install pkexec.
