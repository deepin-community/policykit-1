  * d/clean: Remove unpacked subprojects/mocklibc-1.0/.
    This addresses FTBFS-twice-in-a-row. The subproject is provided in the

  * Install the systemd unit in /usr/lib/systemd/system.
    This was allowed by Technical Committee resolution #1053901. polkit
    has not usually been backported, so it doesn't seem important to make
    backports trivial for this particular package.

  * d/control: Stop recommending polkitd-pkla in policykit-1.

  * d/changelog: Trim trailing whitespace
  * d/upstream/metadata: Update URLs for Bug-Database, Bug-Submit

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Update how we assign root-equivalent groups
    - d/p/debian/50-default.rules-Replace-wheel-group-with-sudo-group.patch,
      d/rules:
      Set up Debian's default root-equivalent group 'sudo' in
      50-default.rules rather than in 40-debian-sudo.rules. This ensures
      that users of polkitd-pkla can override it by configuring admin
      identities the old way. Previously, because 40-debian-sudo.rules was
      earlier in the sequence than 49-polkit-pkla-compat.rules, it would
      take precedence and the admin identities from polkitd-pkla were
      ignored. (Closes: #1023393)
      By default, polkitd-pkla does not provide any admin identities,
      which means we behave as though polkitd-pkla was not installed at all,
      and fall back to the sudo group defined in 50-default.rules.
    - d/p/debian/05_revert-admin-identities-unix-group-wheel.patch:
      Drop patch, superseded by the one described above
    - d/rules: When built for Ubuntu, also install an Ubuntu-specific file
      sequenced after 49-polkit-pkla-compat.rules but before
      50-default.rules, which treats both the 'sudo' group and the legacy
      'admin' group as root-equivalent.
  * Replace /etc/pam.d/polkit-1 with /usr/lib/pam.d/polkit-1.
    /usr/lib/pam.d has been supported since at least 1.4.0 (Debian 11),
    so we can make this an ordinary packaged file instead of a conffile.
    Local sysadmin overrides can still be done via /etc/pam.d/polkit-1
    as before.
    This sidesteps dpkg's inability to keep track of a conffile when it is
    moved from one package to another (#399829, #645849, #163657, #595112).
    (Closes: #1006203)
  * postinst: Only clean up config directories if not owned.
    If we only have polkitd installed, then we want to clean up the obsolete
    directory /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d on upgrade, but if we
    have polkitd-pkla installed, then it owns that directory and we should
    not remove it. (Closes: #1026425)
  * d/policykit-1.dirs: Continue to own some legacy directory names.
    Having the transitional package continue to own these directories until
    it has had a chance to clean up obsolete conffiles will silence warnings
    from dpkg about inability to remove them. (Closes: #1027420)
  * d/polkitd.postrm: Clean up /var/lib/polkit-1 on purge.
    If /var/lib/polkit-1 was the polkitd user's home directory, then it
    might contain a .cache subdirectory; clean that up too.
  * Create polkitd user with home directory /nonexistent in new installations.
    This will prevent it from creating detritus in /var/lib/polkit-1.
  * polkitd.postinst: Change polkitd home directory to /nonexistent on upgrade
  * Remove version constraints unnecessary since buster (oldstable)
  * Update standards version to 4.6.2 (no changes needed)

  * Only build API documentation if policykit-1-doc is built.
    It doesn't need to be built when we're doing an architecture-specific

    If we created or modified the polkitd user, then we need to refresh

  * d/polkitd.postinst: Stop polkitd when not using systemd.
    On non-systemd systems, polkitd is a traditional D-Bus service and is

  * Restructure the package to use upstream project polkit-pkla-compat
    for compatibility with 0.105 and older versions.
    - polkitd-javascript is now the only implementation of polkitd.
      The packages will probably be merged in a future upload, but keep
      them separate for now as a contingency plan.
    - polkitd-pkla now Depends on polkitd-javascript instead of having
      Breaks/Replaces on it. It's now an addon for polkitd-javascript,
      which calls out to an external helper program to check authorization
      against the old pklocalauthority(8) configuration files.
    - polkitd-javascript: Ensure that the polkitd user has a primary group.
      The polkit-pkla-compat package wants its directories to be owned by
      root:polkitd, which will only work if the polkitd user has a
      corresponding polkitd group.
    - Add polkit-pkla-compat as a secondary upstream tarball

  * d/control: Change descriptions to refer to polkit.
    According to NEWS, the official name of the project has been polkit
    since 2012, and perhaps earlier.
  * d/patches: Use upstream's finalized patch for CVE-2021-4034.
    The patch that was provided to distributors under embargo was not the
    final version: it used a different exit status, and made an attempt to
    show help. The version that was actually committed after the embargo
    period ended interprets argc == 0 as an attack rather than a mistake,
    and does not attempt to show the help message.
  * d/patches: Move Debian-specific patches to d/p/debian/.
    This makes it clearer that these are not intended to go upstream.
  * Split policykit-1 into polkitd and pkexec packages.
    pkexec is a setuid program, which makes it a higher security risk than
    the more typical IPC-based uses of polkit. If we separate out pkexec
    into its own package, then only packages that rely on being able to run
    pkexec will have to depend on it, reducing attack surface for users
    who are able to remove the pkexec package.
  * Reinstate the .pkla backend as a separate binary package.
    Upstream polkit switched its authorization rule syntax from .ini-style
    .pkla files to JavaScript in version 0.106. Debian has historically used
    a fork of the last .pkla-based version, but this was becoming
    unsustainable: bug fixes from subsequent upstream versions were either
    applied as patches, or missing from the Debian package.
    The "local authority" code that implements .pkla files is not actually
    all that large, so patching it into a modern upstream version is a
    much smaller task than patching modern upstream bug fixes into an old
    upstream version.
    For this upload to experimental, keep both the JavaScript backend and the
    .pkla backend intact, by compiling polkitd twice with different options.
    This lets us preserve existing functionality of upstream and experimental
    polkit (with the more powerful JavaScript-based rules, which can base
    their authorization decisions on service-specific information like the
    name of a systemd unit), while also having the opportunity to evaluate
    polkitd-pkla as a more direct replacement for what's in bookworm.
  * Adjust Lintian override syntax
  * Add Debian-specific man pages for polkitd-pkla
  * d/copyright: Update
  * Always configure the sudo group as root-equivalent.
    This avoids Debian derivatives getting an unexpected change in behaviour
    when they switch from inheriting Debian's policykit-1 package to
    building their own policykit-1 package, perhaps as a result of wanting
    to apply an unrelated patch.
    The sudo group is defined to be root-equivalent in base-passwd, so this
    should be equally true for all Debian derivatives.

  * Move D-Bus policy file to /usr/share/dbus-1/system.d/
    To better support stateless systems with an empty /etc, the old location
    in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/ should only be used for local admin changes.

  * Use https:// for the upstream homepage.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Use PAM's common-session-noninteractive modules for pkexec instead of
    common-session. The latter also runs pam_systemd (the only difference
    normally) which is a no-op under the classic session-centric
    D-BUS/graphical login model (as it won't start a new one if it is already
    running within a logind session), but very expensive when using
    dbus-user-session and being called from a service that runs outside the
    PAM session. This causes long delays in e. g. gnome-settings-daemon's
    backlight helpers. (LP: #1626651)

      Debian-specific (mainly for Ubuntu's benefit, really).
    - 05_revert-admin-identities-unix-group-wheel.patch: Debian does
      not use the "wheel" group like Red Hat derivatives do;
      treat uid 0 as the administrative identity instead.

    - Add libmozjs185-dev for the JS rules support.
  * Remove polkitbackend library.
  * Use systemd service file provided by upstream.
  * Reload systemd as the name of the .service file has changed.
  * Update policykit-1.install:
    - Private binaries have been moved to /usr/lib/polkit-1.
    - The extension system has been removed.
    - The .pkla files are gone and so is /var/lib/polkit-1.
  * Remove obsolete conffiles and the corresponding (empty) directories on

  * Convert the old localauthority conf files to the new JavaScript based
    rules file format and make sure it is executed before 50-default.rules.
  * Refresh patches to apply without fuzz.
  * The polkitd daemon now runs as unprivileged polkitd user instead of root.
    Create this system user in postinst and change the directory permissions

  * Use upstream patch for CVE-2021-3560.
    This patch was included in 0.119, so move it into the 0.119/ directory
    in the patch series.
  * d/patches: Use upstream's finalized patch for CVE-2021-4034.
    The patch that was provided to distributors under embargo was not the
    final version: it used a different exit status, and made an attempt to
    show help. The version that was actually committed after the embargo
    period ended interprets argc == 0 as an attack rather than a mistake,
    and does not attempt to show the help message.
  * Move some Debian-specific patches into d/p/debian/.
    This makes it more obvious that they are not intended to go upstream.
  * d/control: Split the package.
    pkexec is a setuid program, which makes it a higher security risk than
    the more typical IPC-based uses of polkit. If we separate out pkexec
    into its own package, then only packages that rely on being able to run
    pkexec will have to depend on it, reducing attack surface for users
    who are able to remove the pkexec package.
  * d/control: policykit-1 Provides polkitd-pkla.
    This will give us a migration path to the separate per-backend packages
    currently available in experimental.
  * Add patch from Fedora to fix denial of service via fd exhaustion.
    CVE-2021-4115 (Closes: #1005784)
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.0 (no changes required)
  * Build-depend on dbus-daemon instead of dbus.
    We only need dbus-run-session at build time; we don't need a
    fully-working system bus.
  * Use d/watch format version 4
  * d/rules: Create localauthority configuration with install(1), not
    echo(1). This aligns the packaging a bit more closely with experimental.
  * Always configure the sudo group as root-equivalent.
    This avoids Debian derivatives getting an unexpected change in behaviour
    when they switch from inheriting Debian's policykit-1 package to
    building their own policykit-1 package, perhaps as a result of wanting
    to apply an unrelated patch.
    The sudo group is defined to be root-equivalent in base-passwd, so this
    should be equally true for all Debian derivatives.
    Thanks to Arnaud Rebillout.
  * d/polkitd.links: Create more polkit-agent-helper-1 symlinks.
    This executable has moved several times, and its path gets compiled
    into the libpolkit-agent-1-0 shared library. Making the executable
    available in all the locations it has previously had is helpful when
    swapping between versions during testing.

  * Stop building libpolkit-backend as a shared library.
    Its API was never declared stable before upstream removed it in
    0.106. Nothing in Debian depended on it, except for polkitd itself,
    which now links the same code statically.
    This is a step towards being able to use the current upstream release of
    polkit and patch in the old localauthority backend as an alternative to
    the JavaScript backend, instead of using the old 0.105 codebase and
    patching in essentially every change except the JavaScript backend,
    which is becoming unmanageable.
    - Remove the example null backend, which is pointless now that we've
      removed the ability to extend polkit.

  * Move D-Bus policy file to /usr/share/dbus-1/system.d/
    To better support stateless systems with an empty /etc, the old location

  * Use https:// for the upstream homepage.

    dependency (Closes: #837846)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Use PAM's common-session-noninteractive modules for pkexec instead of
    common-session. The latter also runs pam_systemd (the only difference
    normally) which is a no-op under the classic session-centric
    D-BUS/graphical login model (as it won't start a new one if it is already
    running within a logind session), but very expensive when using
    dbus-user-session and being called from a service that runs outside the
    PAM session. This causes long delays in e. g. gnome-settings-daemon's
    backlight helpers. (LP: #1626651)
